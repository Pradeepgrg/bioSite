            <h2 class="title">About me</h2>
            <p>My name is Netra Gurung and I was working as a project manager in IT company for 10 years and now currently I have my own business
                in Omaha, Nebraska. I was grown up around Army community because My father was an Army. I loved heroic stories of patriotism as I listened 
                from my father. I was always dreamed to join Army and serve my country. I tried so hard and continuously applied to join the army 
                but I always failed because of my health condition so I decided to stop the dreaming of becoming an Army. After that I was focused on 
                my study and came USA in 2002 for further studies. </p>
            <br>

            <p>I usually spends my leisure time with my family and most of the time I am working on my business. If I had to describe myself in simple terms, that would be it.
                The creative process is part of drives me and who I am. In my project manager career, I accomplished the respect and loyalty from my team members
                through proper leadership, consistent behavior and by showing the project team the same loyalty and respect. My senior managers appreciate
                many times for my hard working in the project.</p>
            <br>

            <p>I believed that everything depends on us to be successful or not to be; it all depends on our courage to accept any challenges in our life.
                So we have to be strong enough to use it open the door to success. And also I believed that family is the most important part in successful
                life. Without family support no one man can reach on the top.</p>
